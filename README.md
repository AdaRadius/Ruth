# Ruth and Roth 2.0 Mesh Avatar Project

Ruth and Roth 2.0 are low-poly mesh bodies, specifically designed for OpenSimulator. They are built to use standard Second Life(TM) UV maps using scratch-built open source mesh bodies by Shin Ingen with other open source contributions from the OpenSimulator Community.

## RC3 Archive Branch

This is an archival branch of the Ruth repo as of 17Jan2019 following
some cleanups to archive RC2 and collect some of the RC3 files that were
uploaded to grids but not present in the repo.

If further RC3 files are located (such as the .DAE files actually used for
the RC3 uploads) they will be added here for archival reference.

## Current Release

The Ruth/Roth 2.0 current release files have previously been kept in a number of
'Current Release' directories before now.  We have renamed these
directories to 'Release' as there is no longer a need to distinguish which
release they belong to.

## Previous Release

The Ruth 2.0 RC2 release files have been kept in a number of 'Previous Release'
directories in the repo.  These have been archived into a git branch named
'archive-ruth-rc2' and the directories renamed 'Release' in that branch.  These
'Previous Release' directories will be removed from the master branch in the
near future.  They will remain in the `archive-ruth-rc3` branch.

## Personal Directories

We have moved all personal directories under the new top-level directory
'Contrib'.  These continue to be used as they always have, as a place for
team members to put things that are still under development before (or until)
they are merged into the master release directories.
